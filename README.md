# Titanic EDA - Deepak

A step-by-step Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the famous **Titanic dataset**, focusing on data cleaning, visualization, and extracting survival insights.

---

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to perform data analysis on the Titanic dataset using Python.  
The goal is to explore passenger demographics, ticket information, and survival patterns.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)  
- **Jupyter Notebook** for analysis and visualization  

---

## 🔎 Key Steps in Analysis
1. Data Loading & Cleaning (handling null values, formatting columns)  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (distributions, correlations, survival rates)  
3. Visualizations (count plots, box plots, histograms, heatmaps)  
4. Insights on passenger survival factors (gender, age, class, fare, etc.)  

---

## 📊 Sample Visualizations
- Survival count based on Gender  
- Age distribution among survivors  
- Class vs Survival analysis
